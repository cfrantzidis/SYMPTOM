I planned a whole surprise dinner, and she just looked… tired. Not unhappy, just unreachable.	7

	7

It’s like my emotional dial is stuck on zero, no matter what happens around me	7
I know this should be a moment I’ll remember — but I feel detached from it, like I’m not even here	7
We went to his favorite comedy show, and he sat there like a statue	7
She got terrible news last week, and she just shrugged — not because she didn’t care, but because she couldn’t feel it	7
Even when she’s surrounded by people who love her, it’s like she’s miles away emotionally	7
He used to get so worked up about politics, music, everything — now there’s just silence	7
It’s not that she’s cold — it’s like her emotions are missing entirely.	7
I used to know how she was feeling. Now I look at her and can’t read anything	7
He laughs at my jokes, but it never reaches his eyes	7
She says she feels like a robot — and honestly, sometimes it feels that way too	7

My emotional range used to be a symphony. Now it’s a single, flat note	7
	7
Good memories make me sad now, because I can’t feel what they meant to me back then	7
Even when I try to force a reaction, like crying or laughing, nothing comes.	7
I forget what it’s like to be genuinely moved by something — a film, a sunset, even someone hugging me.	7
I feel like I’m playing a role in a movie where the script is blank	7
My emotions are on mute — I can see others feeling things, but I’m behind a soundproof wall	7
My mood flips without warning — one minute I’m okay, the next I’m spiraling	7
It’s like my emotions are on a roller coaster, but I can’t get off	7
I cry over spilled coffee, then sit numb through a funeral — it makes no sense	7
I go from hopeless to angry in seconds, and I don’t understand why	7
Sometimes I feel too much, too fast — other times, I feel nothing at all.	7
I hate that I can’t trust my own feelings — they change like the weather	7
The smallest comment can ruin my whole day, and I hate how sensitive I’ve become	7
I lash out and then feel crushed with guilt an hour later — it’s exhausting	7
Even when I know I’m overreacting, I can’t stop the storm inside me.	7
I never know which version of me is going to wake up tomorrow.	7
She seems okay in the morning, then breaks down by lunch	7
He’s irritable all the time — and then suddenly he’s sobbing without explanation	7
Her emotions are unpredictable — it’s like walking on eggshells	7
He swings from silence to rage and back again within the same hour	7
I never know if I’ll come home to calm, or chaos	7
She says she hates me one moment, then begs me not to leave the next.	7
He cries over tiny things, then shrugs at huge problems — I don’t know what’s real anymore.	7
She gets angry with herself for being ‘too emotional,’ but she can’t help it.	7
His moods come in waves — intense, disorienting, and completely out of his control.	7
Every day feels emotionally unstable — for her, and for us too.	7
No matter what happens, my emotions don’t change — it’s like I’m stuck on one channel.	7
I can’t remember the last time something moved me — even a little.	7
I laugh because people expect me to — not because anything is funny.	7
I miss feeling things. Even the bad stuff. At least it made me feel alive	7
I don’t react to news, music, hugs — it’s like my body shows up, but my emotions stay behind	7
It’s like she’s emotionally frozen. Nothing lights her up, not even her grandchildren	7
He watches sad movies without blinking — it’s eerie.	7
Her smile looks like a reflex, not a real response	7
Some days I’m hollow, other days I’m a storm	7
"I cry at nothing and snap over everything — it’s exhausting.	7
I feel ashamed of my mood swings, but I can’t control them.	7
My emotions shift so fast, I can’t keep up with myself.	7
I hate that I scare the people I love just by being unpredictable.	7
She can go from fine to furious in seconds — we all tiptoe around her.	7
One minute he’s withdrawn, the next he’s sobbing in my arms	7
Her moods don’t just change — they crash and spike like a wave	7
I smiled at the funeral — not because I was okay, but because I didn’t feel anything	7
I say the right things, but inside, nothing lines up with my words.	7
I feel like a spectator in my own life, watching someone else speak and react.	7
I feel bad for not feeling bad — like I’m failing at being human.	7
He didn’t flinch when his mother died. Not because he didn’t care, but because he couldn’t.	7
She smiles and nods like everything’s fine — but her eyes are somewhere else entirely.	7
He talks about tragedy like it’s the weather — calm, removed, unshaken.	7
No matter what happens, my reaction is always the same — nothing	7
I don’t cry anymore, even when I want to	7
Joy used to feel like sunlight — now it’s just a memory	7
She didn’t react when our son got accepted to college — just nodded	7
He looks at family photos like they’re images from a stranger’s life.	7
I can feel fine in the morning, then crash by lunchtime with no warning	7
I swing between anger, guilt, and emptiness in one afternoon.	7
Some days I just snap — and later, I can’t even explain why.	7
She’s either silent or furious — there’s rarely an in-between	7
He’s so sensitive now. One look, one word — and he breaks.	7
I laugh when I’m supposed to, but it doesn’t feel real.	7
People cry around me, and I just sit there, blank	7
I smile because I’m expected to — not because I feel like it	7
She told me she loved me, but it sounded hollow — like she was reading a line	7
He doesn’t flinch when things go wrong anymore — not even a sigh.	7
Even when good things happen, it doesn’t touch me.	7
It’s like happiness bounces off of me instead of sinking in	7
My birthday used to make me happy — now it’s just another day to survive	7
We surprised him with a party — and he thanked us, but I could tell he wasn’t there emotionally.	7
Her laughter used to be contagious. Now it’s gone — even when we try everything to bring it back	7
I feel like I’ve lost the part of me that used to feel alive	7
I used to be passionate — now I barely recognize myself.	7
My emotions feel like echoes of someone I used to be.	7
She used to be so expressive — now it’s like she’s a shadow of herself.	7
I miss the way he used to light up when he talked about his dreams.	7
I feel like I’m already dead inside — ending it would just make it official.	6
Nothing moves me anymore. There’s no point in going on like this	6
Each morning feels like a punishment for being alive.	6
I feel like a failure for needing love and still feeling empty.	6
I can smile in public, but at night I fantasize about not waking up.	6
The highs I feel are never enough to stop the crashing lows	6
My thoughts race — I can’t slow them down — and death feels like the only silence I could trust.	6
I feel like I'm crawling out of my skin. I want to scream or vanish — anything to stop this feeling.	6
The pain is loud and constant. I can’t bear it anymore.	6
The voices say I deserve to die — and sometimes I believe them	6
I’m convinced the world would be better without me — it's not just a feeling, it’s a fact.	6
My mind tells me death is the only escape from this punishment.	6
"I’m terrified all the time — of life, of myself, of what I might do	6
The fear is constant, and ending everything feels like the only way to stop it.	6
My body shakes with panic, and my mind begs me to end it	6
I’ve tried everything. Pills, therapy, everything. Nothing works.	6
I’m exhausted from fighting a war I can’t win	6
I’m scared that this is all there is — endless suffering with no way out.	6
He talks about death so calmly now — like it’s a decision already made.	6
She said the pills weren’t helping, and now I watch her like she might disappear.	6
He stopped talking about the future — even when our baby was born.	6
She gives away her things like she’s preparing to leave.	6
He wrote a note and deleted it. I read enough to know he’s serious.	6
She looks at me like she’s saying goodbye with her eyes.	6
Even the hospital didn’t shake him — he said he’d ‘try harder next time.’	6
I hurt myself because it's the only way I know I’m still real.	6
I can’t trust my feelings — they change so fast I feel like I’m losing my mind.	6
Sometimes I cut because I need the pain to match what’s inside me.	6
I don’t want to die. I just don’t know how to live like this anymore.	6
I wake up hating myself and go to sleep wishing I wouldn’t wake up again	6
I promised myself I’d stop — but the pressure builds and suddenly I’m bleeding again	6
It’s like there's a switch in my head — one second I’m fine, the next I’m planning my death	6
I feel ashamed even before I hurt myself, but I still do it — because it silences the chaos.	6
The suicidal thoughts are always there. Some days, they're whispers. Other days, they scream	6
I keep trying to ask for help, but no one seems to understand how fast everything falls apart	6
I’ve thought about suicide more times than I’ve brushed my teeth this week.	6
The pain doesn’t stop, so the thoughts don’t either	6
Every failed treatment makes me more certain I’ll never get better.	6
I’m scared of dying, but I’m more scared of living like this forever.	6
I don’t tell anyone how dark it gets because I’m afraid they’ll lock me away — or worse, ignore me.	6
She says she doesn’t want to die — but the scars tell another story.	6
He swings between needing love and pushing everyone away — and in between, he hurts himself.	6
I can’t leave her alone for too long. The last time, she overdosed	6
Every time I hear a bang from the bathroom, I run. I never know what I’m about to find.	6
He said the scars help him cope — I don’t know how to respond to that	6
She texts me just after hurting herself. It's her way of asking for help, but it breaks me every time.	6
He tells me he won’t try again, but the way he says it makes me think he already has a plan.	6
I don’t know what’s wrong with me — I just want everything to stop.	6
Sometimes I drink just to quiet the thoughts	6
No one at school sees how hard I’m struggling. I wear long sleeves for a reason.	6
I act like I don’t care, but I think about dying every day.	6
I get in fights because being angry is easier than feeling sad all the time.	6
My parents think I’m lazy — they don’t know I’m barely hanging on.	6
"I stay up at night wondering if tomorrow is worth it	6
They say I’m too young to feel like this — but I don’t feel young, I feel broken	6
I post funny things online, but inside I’m thinking about ending it all.	6
Cutting doesn’t scare me anymore — not feeling anything does.	6
He used to be loud and full of energy — now he barely speaks and sleeps all day	6
She’s failing classes, fighting with us, and hiding everything — and I’m terrified I’m losing her	6
He says he’s fine, but the cuts on his arm tell a different story	6
I found a note in her notebook. It started with ‘If you’re reading this, I’m sorry…	6
We thought it was just teenage mood swings — until he ended up in the ER.	6
She laughs with her friends, then cries alone in her room. I don’t know who she really is anymore	6
He told me he doesn’t plan for the future — because he doesn’t see one	6
She’s not just sad. She’s hurting — and she doesn’t know how to ask for help	6
It feels like I’m stuck in a tunnel with no way out.	6
Every day I wake up disappointed that I didn’t disappear in my sleep.	6
I’ve stopped dreaming about the future — I don’t see myself in it.	6
When people say 'it gets better,' I wonder if they’ve ever felt like this	6
I’m tired of pretending I’m okay when I feel like I’m falling apart inside	6
I get angry so fast — it’s like fire under my skin and no way to put it out	6
I break things or yell, and then I hate myself afterward.	6
The fights I get into are just my way of saying ‘I need help,’ but no one hears me	6
I act like I don’t care because caring hurts too much	6
I started drinking so I could sleep — now I drink to get through the day.	6
The pills quiet the noise in my head for a while, but it always comes back louder.	6
I smoke because it’s the only time I feel relaxed — even if it's temporary	6
When I’m high, I forget how much I hate myself.	6
No one at home listens unless I’m screaming.	6
They argue all the time — I just want peace or silence.	6
My parents say I’m too emotional, but I’ve learned to hide everything now.	6
I told my mom I wanted to die, and she said I was being dramatic.	6
She used to slam doors and scream — now she barely speaks	6
I thought the weed was just teenage rebellion — now I wonder if it’s pain management.	6
He lashes out at school and then collapses at home — like a balloon that just deflated	6
We were so focused on his grades, we missed the signs he wanted to hurt himself	6
She said she hated us — but I think she hates herself even more.	6
Each debt letter felt like another shovel of earth over my future.	6
Even with friends around me, I was sinking deeper into silence.	6
I didn’t want to die… I just couldn’t see a way to live with this pain.	6
Suicide became the quiet companion I turned to when everything else failed	6
Oddly, the more I considered death, the more relief I felt from the weight of decisions.	6
I had dinner with friends and played tennis, but my heart was counting down to goodbye.	6
Driving around with the gun, I didn’t feel fear — only numb certainty.	6
Leaving letters for my children was harder than deciding to leave life.	6
In that final moment, it wasn’t my life I was trying to save — it was theirs, from my failure.	6
What stopped me was not therapy, not medication, but the voice of a friend who didn’t let go	6
I was torn between the relief of ending it and the guilt of leaving them behind.	6
I felt peace knowing I had the means to end it — and agony knowing I might use it.	6
The pain wasn’t physical, but it screamed louder than any wound.	6
Mental anguish ate at me every hour; dying seemed like the only painkiller.	6
There was no future left in my calendar — only regret and ruin.	6
I stopped thinking about solutions and started writing goodbyes	6
I could smile, toast, laugh — all while making peace with dying.	6
They saw a businessman holding it together — not a man already gone inside.	6
He looked composed — until I read the letters he left behind.	6
Even his best mood was a red flag in disguise.	6
The shift from hopelessness to peace wasn’t recovery — it was resolution to die	6
We missed the turning point because he hid it behind routines and politeness.	6
Only by listening — really listening — did we hear the death in his silence.	6
I skip meals and skip school, but no one asks why. Maybe they already expect me to disappear	6
I act tough at school, but when I’m alone, I wish I didn’t wake up.	6
My parents are too busy surviving to notice I’m falling apart.	6
I cut where they won’t see, because in my house we don’t talk about feelings.	6
I get straight A’s and smile in photos, but at night I plan how to make it stop.	6
They think money solves everything, but I feel completely alone in this house	6
I have everything I’m supposed to need — and still want out.	6
The pressure to be okay is louder than the pain that’s killing me.	6
Laid off again. Can’t provide. Can’t cope. Maybe they’d be better off without me.	6
I don’t have the strength to look for work — but I still have enough to write a goodbye note	6
I patch clothes, stretch meals, and swallow pain until I choke on it.	6
I don’t want to die, but I don’t see a way to live that isn’t suffering.	6
They see the suit, not the noose tightening around my mind.	6
I make deals in boardrooms and bargain with death in the dark.	6
They say I’m accomplished. I feel like a fraud held together by fear and sleeping pills.	6
I drive carpool in the morning and wonder if I’ll drive off the bridge on the way home	6
I feel everything too deeply. Even silence cuts.	6
Sometimes I hurt myself to feel in control — to feel anything.	6
I was raised not to talk about pain, so I bleed it instead.	6
If I tell anyone how I feel, I’m weak. If I don’t, I might not survive	6
She decorated her room with fairy lights, then wrote a suicide note under them."	6
He said ‘I’m fine’ right before swallowing a bottle of pills	6
She cleaned the house before she tried to leave us — as if preparing for a long trip.	6
He kissed our son goodbye like it was the last time, and I didn’t see it then.	6
I keep going over everything I’ve done wrong. It’s like I’m on trial in my own head	5
Even when it wasn’t my fault, I felt like I’d failed everyone.	5
I don’t just feel guilty — I feel like I deserve to be punished.	5
I told myself over and over that I ruined my relationships, that I brought this on myself.	5
I wasn’t just sorry — I was ashamed of existing	5
I felt like less than nothing, like a hollow version of a person.	5
Even when I achieved something, I still believed I was worthless	5
I couldn't shake the feeling that I was fundamentally broken	5
It didn’t matter how much people reassured me — I knew I wasn’t good enough	5
There was no point in trying. I had already failed at being a human	5
I felt self-disgust. I couldn’t stand to look at myself in the mirror	5
It wasn’t just guilt — it was self-loathing, self-hate, like I was rotting inside	5
It felt like contempt — for everything I am and everything I ever did.	5
I was drowning in shame. It covered me like a skin I couldn’t shed	5
She described herself as unworthy of love — not just feeling sad, but as if she were inherently bad	5
He didn’t say he was guilty. He said he was ‘disgusted with the kind of person he had become	5
She said she hated herself more than she could put into words. And I believed her	5
I keep replaying the past in my head, like a punishment loop I can’t escape	5
It doesn’t matter what I do now — I’ll never undo the harm I caused	5
I don’t just feel guilty — I feel like everything wrong is somehow my fault	5
Even when they forgave me, I couldn’t forgive myself	5
The guilt is always there. It follows me like a shadow I can’t step out of.	5
I’m ashamed of who I am, not just what I’ve done.	5
I feel like I’m a bad person — not because of any crime, but because of how I exist.	5
I avoid people not because I hate them, but because I believe they’ll see how awful I really am	5
The shame isn’t tied to any one thing — it’s stitched into my skin	5
Looking in the mirror feels like staring at a monster I created.	5
Sometimes I wish I could scrub myself away — like all the filth I feel inside.	5
I feel contaminated by my own thoughts, my own history.	5
Even when I do something kind, it feels fake — because deep down I know I’m disgusting.	5
I don’t believe I matter — not to anyone, not even to myself.	5
The world would be lighter without the weight of me in it.	5
I’m not enough. I never was. I don’t see how I ever could be.	5
All I do is fail, and that’s the only thing I’ve ever been good at	5
She apologized for everything — for existing, for talking, for crying.	5
He seemed to carry the weight of old guilt like it was fused to his spine	5
She didn’t just feel sorry — she truly believed she deserved to suffer.	5
Even when it’s not my fault, I still feel responsible — like I caused it by existing	5
I apologize for things I didn’t do because guilt just lives in me now	5
It’s like my brain fills in gaps with ways to blame myself.	5
They say ‘it’s not you,’ but I still carry the shame like it’s mine to hold.	5
I don’t feel guilty about one thing — I feel guilty about everything	5
My mistakes from years ago haunt me like they happened yesterday	5
There’s no boundary to the guilt — it spills over into everything I do.	5
I can’t even enjoy good moments because I feel I don’t deserve them	5
I don’t even know why I feel guilty anymore — it’s just always there	5
Sometimes I catch myself apologizing just for talking.	5
It’s not about what I did — it’s about what I am.	5
I live with a permanent sense that I’m failing someone, somewhere.	5
I’m not just flawed — I’m fundamentally wrong	5
People say everyone has value, but I can’t find mine	5
The world feels like it would go on just fine without me in it.	5
When I think about my life, all I see is waste and missed chances.	5
She said guilt wasn’t a reaction — it was a state of being.	5
He spoke about himself as though he were an irredeemable failure.	5
Even when no one blamed her, she blamed herself anyway.	5
I felt so guilty just for being offered help — like I hadn’t earned kindness	5
When someone gave me something generous, my first reaction was to reject it — I didn’t think I deserved it.	5
I say 'I’m sorry' a hundred times a day, even when nothing’s my fault.	5
If something goes wrong in a group, I immediately assume it’s my fault	5
The disgust I feel for myself makes it impossible to believe I’m worth anything — not money, not time, not love.	5
They offered me an equal share, but I turned it down. I didn’t want to be seen as greedy — or seen at all	5
It’s hard to accept anything good when you believe you're bad	5
I gave them more than I kept for myself — it felt like the only way to make up for who I am	5
Every decision I make is filtered through guilt — even when buying a coffee, I question if I deserve it	5
She declines fair treatment out of a belief that she’s morally inferior	5
Even when treated kindly, he appears to internalize shame, assuming it’s a mistake or obligation	5
Her financial decisions are punishing — not practical. It’s like she wants to erase her own needs	5
I wish I could disappear when I mess up — not face the people I’ve let down.	5
The shame makes me want to crawl into bed and never come out	5
I mess up the smallest thing and feel like I’ve committed a crime.	5
I keep thinking: if I were a better person, this wouldn’t have happened.	5
Even when no one’s angry, I feel like I deserve to be punished	5
My mind finds a way to turn every mistake into evidence of how bad I am	5
I don’t feel like a person with flaws — I feel like a flaw.	5
No matter what I do, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m fundamentally broken.	5
There’s no role I belong in — not as a friend, not as a partner, not even as myself.	5
Even when people forgive me, I still believe I’m unworthy of it.	5
I feel like a walking burden — not someone who’s struggling, but someone who shouldn’t exist.	5
When I feel guilty, I don’t try to make things right — I try to disappear	5
The guilt builds up until the only answer I can think of is hurting myself	5
Sometimes I apologize so much it becomes meaningless — but I can’t stop	5
I hide not because I want to, but because I believe they’re better off not seeing me.	5
I blame myself for everything — then hate myself for not being able to fix it.	5
The more guilt I feel, the smaller I become, until I don’t feel like I deserve to take up space.	5
It's like I was born wrong — not just someone who does bad things, but someone who is bad.	5
I feel like I’ve broken some unspoken rule of being a good person	5
Even small mistakes make me feel like I’ve failed morally — like I’m corrupt at my core	5
It’s not about what I did — it’s about who I am: someone who always lets others down	5
Every time I remember something I said wrong, it stings like I’ve sinned	5
I’m not just sorry — I feel like I deserve judgment.	5
I’ve lost any sense that I’m a decent human being.	5
No matter what I do right, it doesn’t cancel out how wrong I feel inside.	5
I see myself as broken beyond repair — not just flawed, but fundamentally wrong.	5
It’s like I’m living in moral exile — I can’t be part of the human community anymore.	5
There’s no redemption for the kind of person I’ve become	5
I can’t stop thinking about what I’ve done — it plays on repeat like a punishment	5
Even if no one else blames me, I know I crossed a line I shouldn’t have	5
I feel like I’ve committed a moral crime, and no one can convince me otherwise.	5
I’ve hurt people — even if it wasn’t on purpose — and that’s something I’ll never forgive myself for.	5
I don’t feel like I deserve to be part of the world after what I did	5
It’s not just that I made a mistake — it’s that I lost who I was meant to be.	5
What’s left of me isn’t a person, it’s a shell of someone who failed morally.	5
I see myself as someone who’s beyond forgiveness	5
I shouldn't have asked for help; everyone's already dealing with enough	5
I feel like I'm failing at everything — school, friends, life.	5
Even when I do well, I feel guilty for not doing more.	5
I'm just a burden — there's nothing good about me.	5
I don’t think I’m good enough for any job, relationship, or future.	5
I blame myself for things going wrong, even if I had no control.	5
Success feels undeserved, like I cheated someone else out of it.	5
I feel like I’ll never be anything — not smart, not capable, not enough	5
I can't forgive myself for the mistakes I made with my kids.	5
Even with everything I have, I feel like I'm nothing inside.	5
People see me as successful, but I feel like a fraud.	5
I’ve let my family down — I can’t make ends meet and it’s killing me inside	5
I feel forgotten, like my life doesn’t matter anymore.	5
I regret so many things — not being there, not doing better	5
I feel like a burden to my children — they’d be better off without me.	5
I worked my whole life, but now I feel like I contribute nothing.	5
I open the fridge and feel nothing — not hunger, not interest, just emptiness	4
Eating feels like a chore I can’t be bothered with	4
Food used to bring me comfort. Now I barely notice it’s there.	4
I’ve lost so much weight without trying — it’s like my body’s disappearing with my mood.	4
When I’m this low, the thought of chewing and swallowing is exhausting	4
I keep eating even when I’m not hungry — it’s like I’m trying to fill a hole inside me	4
Food is the only thing I look forward to, even though I hate myself after	4
I eat just to feel something — anything.	4
The weight gain makes me feel worse, but I can’t stop snacking through the sadness	4
Sometimes I eat until I feel sick — it’s the only time I feel full in any sense.	4
I bounce between starving myself and bingeing, depending on how numb or anxious I feel.	4
My appetite swings wildly — one week I’m repulsed by food, the next I can’t stop eating	4
No matter what my weight is, I feel wrong in my body — too much or too little of something	4
Lunchtime used to be fun, but now I sit there pretending to eat because I just can't stomach it.	4
I eat junk all night — it’s the only thing that distracts me from how low I feel	4
I feel gross no matter what I eat, so I just skip meals to feel some control.	4
Most days I go until dinner without realizing I haven’t eaten a thing	4
I binge when I feel sad, then hate myself for not having control	4
Some weeks I stuff myself. Others, I forget food exists	4
Even cooking feels overwhelming, so I just don’t eat unless someone reminds me	4
Work’s a mess, I’m broke, and the only thing I can afford emotionally is comfort food.	4
I gained so much weight and now I avoid people because I feel disgusting.	4
I lost over ten kilos last year, but honestly, I didn’t even notice — nothing tastes like anything	4
Sometimes I skip meals not just from sadness, but to save money. It’s all the same emptiness	4
I don’t feel hungry, but I keep eating just so no one worries	4

Whenever I'm stressed, I raid the pantry. I don’t even think about it anymore	4
I feel like I have to choose between being happy and being thin — and I’m failing at both	4
I forget what hunger feels like — my body doesn't ask for food anymore.	4
I eat to feel better, then hate myself after. It's a loop I can’t break	4

I count every calorie obsessively — it’s the one thing I feel I can still control	4
Sometimes I overeat not out of hunger, but because I’ve gone hungry before	4
Every pound I gain feels like proof I’ve lost control of my life	4
Food has no taste anymore. I eat because I have to, not because I want to.	4

I know I should eat, but the idea of chewing makes me feel sick.	4
My stomach never growls anymore. It's like my body gave up asking	4

Even my favorite foods taste like cardboard now.	4
I look in the mirror and see someone wasting away — and still, I can't make myself care	4
I eat all the time, even when I’m not hungry — especially when I’m alone	4
I’ll open a bag of chips and finish it before realizing what I’m doing.	4
Every bite feels like a distraction from the pain — until the guilt kicks in.	4
I’ve put on so much weight since the depression started, and I hate myself for it.	4
I use food to soothe myself, but it never works for long	4

I swing between starving myself and bingeing — there’s no in-between.	4

No one notices when I skip meals — not even me	4
Food used to be a shared experience. Now, it just reminds me I’m alone.	4

Even when I try to eat, my stomach turns — it's like my system is stuck in stress mode	4
I feel hollow, but not in a way that food can fix	4
I don’t feel hunger the way I used to. It’s like that signal's been shut off completely.	4
When the sadness hits hardest, I crave sweets — like my brain is chasing something it’s missing	4
It’s not comfort eating — it’s desperation eating. Something in me is broken and food is my only tool.	4
Even when I'm full, I keep eating. The fullness is physical, but the emptiness is emotional.	4
I can’t stop eating, and I hate that it’s the only thing that feels rewarding anymore.	4
My hunger cues are messed up — either I feel nothing or I'm ravenous without warning	4

My body reacts to stress with hunger spikes — it’s like the craving comes from my immune system	4
I eat to distract myself from how sick and tired I feel all the time.	4

It feels like my body is in permanent fight-or-flight mode — I’m too wired to feel hunger	4
My stress hormones are on overdrive, but instead of needing food, I feel nauseated by it.	4
When the panic sets in, my stomach locks up — food becomes the last thing I want	4
Even the smell of food makes me queasy when my nerves are buzzing like this.	4
The inflammation must be in my brain too — all I want is sugar, fat, and something to numb the fog	4

I feel like no matter what I eat, I gain weight — like my body is wired against me	4
Since the depression started, my body clings to fat, especially around my belly — and I hate how I look	4
My appetite feels hijacked — I crave food when I’m not hungry and feel worse after eating	4
I’ve lost control of my eating. It feels biological, like something deeper than willpower.	4
The more weight I gain, the more depressed I feel — and the more I eat to cope	4

It starts with a bite and ends in bingeing — I watch it happen and can't stop myself	4
My body’s getting heavier, but food is the only thing that feels rewarding anymore	4
I know it’s emotional eating, but sadness turns into cravings before I know it.	4
Some weeks I starve myself by accident. Other weeks, I eat like I’m trying to disappear under the weight	4
There’s no rhythm to it anymore — food has lost its meaning, and I just drift between hunger and guilt.	4
I wake up not wanting to eat, then binge late at night to feel something.	4
It’s either control through starvation or losing control through food — never peace	4
They say I’ve gained weight, but snacks are the only thing that help when I feel invisible.	4
At lunch, I pretend to eat. I don't want them to see how broken I feel.	4
No one listens when I say I’m not hungry — they just tell me to eat and smile more	4
I eat at night when everyone’s asleep — it’s the only time I feel okay	4
It feels like my stress hormones are wired wrong — they make me sick when I should be hungry.	4
My cravings feel like they come from somewhere deeper — like my body’s trying to soothe my brain	4
I don’t feel full or hungry anymore — just reactive, out of sync with myself.	4
The more inflamed I feel, the more I eat — even though it only numbs things for a second.	4
Every meal I skip feels like an achievement. Every bite I take feels like a failure	4
My appetite is just another place where I lose the battle for control.	4
I’m ashamed of my weight, but I eat because I don’t know how to comfort myself any other way.	4
Feeding myself feels like a reward I don’t deserve.	4
I lie awake for hours, my thoughts chasing each other in circles — sleep feels out of reach	3
I fall asleep exhausted, only to wake up at 3 a.m. staring at the ceiling again.	3
The night is long and lonely — I wake up more tired than when I went to bed	3
Even when I manage a few hours, it's like my brain never really turns off.	3
I dread bedtime because I know it will be a battle	3
I wake up before the sun, not rested — just empty and alert in a way that hurts.	3
It’s like depression has an alarm clock set for despair at 5 a.m. every day.	3
I don't need an alarm anymore — hopelessness wakes me first.	3
I sleep 10 hours and still feel like I haven't slept at all.	3
My body feels like lead. I sleep through the day because staying awake is unbearable.	3
I go to bed early, wake up late, nap when I can — and I’m still exhausted.	3
Even when I sleep through the night, I wake up feeling like I fought a war in my dreams.	3
Sleep doesn’t help. I’m just as broken when I wake up as I was when I closed my eyes	3
I sleep, but it’s not the kind that heals. It’s just escape	3
My sleep is flipped — I’m wide awake at night and dead tired all day.	3
It feels like my body clock is broken. I sleep at odd hours and feel off constantly.	3
Nothing is in sync — not my mood, not my sleep, not my life	3
Even when I sleep 7 or 8 hours, I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all	3
I dread the nights — they stretch out endlessly with no promise of rest.	3
No matter how tired I am, my thoughts refuse to shut down.	3
I wake up hours before my alarm, staring at the dark ceiling, already exhausted.	3
Falling asleep takes forever, and staying asleep feels like a battle I never win.	3
The night feels like punishment — I barely sleep, and then I have to survive the day	3
I sleep through the alarms, through appointments, through life — I just can’t stay awake.	3
Even after 12 hours in bed, I’m still foggy, like sleep didn’t reach my brain	3
It feels like gravity pulls me back under, no matter how many naps I take	3
I wake up tired, I eat tired, I live tired.	3
All I do is sleep, and yet I feel more broken when I wake up.	3
They call me lazy, but they don’t see that I sleep because I can’t cope	3
The nights are worst — every noise, every worry becomes louder in the silence	3
Sleep used to be easy — now it’s fragmented, light, and full of despair.	3
When I’m low, I sleep 14 hours a day — not to rest, but to disappear	3
My dreams are vivid, overwhelming — I wake up more anxious than I went to bed.	3
Sleep is supposed to be rest, but for me it’s just a different kind of torment	3
"I dread waking up because sleep is the only time I feel slightly less burdened	3
I wake up more tired than when I went to bed — like I’ve been fighting all night instead of resting	3
My partner says I stop breathing in my sleep, but I’m too exhausted to care anymore	3
No matter how many hours I sleep, I drag myself through the day in a fog.	3
I thought it was just depression, but now I wonder if my sleep is broken too	3
I’ve tried every antidepressant, but the fatigue never lifts — maybe it’s something deeper.	3
I wake up gasping sometimes, like my body’s trying to remind me to stay alive.	3
They said it was depression, but nobody checked why I keep falling asleep in meetings.	3
Even when I sleep through the night, my brain feels like it's never rebooted.	3
I used to blame myself for being lazy — now I wonder if I’m suffocating in my sleep	3
Every morning feels like I ran a marathon in my dreams	3
I don’t snore. I crash — and then my body betrays me with shallow, broken breaths.	3
Some days, I nap just to survive — not to rest, but to keep from falling apart	3
Therapy helps my thoughts, but my body still feels like it’s drowning in sleep	3
The worst part is no one believed me when I said I was tired all the time	3
It’s like I’m sleeping with the brakes on — every breath a struggle, even unconscious	3
My dreams don’t restore me. They suffocate me.	3
I feel like I’m aging faster than I should — tired bones, tired brain, tired heart.	3
I’d give anything to wake up and feel normal, just once	3
Sleep feels dangerous — a place where I lose control and forget how to breathe.	3
This isn’t just sadness. This is cellular exhaustion.	3
I used to think I was lazy. Turns out I was starved for oxygen.	3
When I finally got a sleep study, it was like someone turned on a light in my brain.	3
After starting CPAP, I realized what real rest feels like — and how long I’ve been without it.	3
I wonder how many years I’ve lived in a fog, thinking it was all in my head.	3
My depression didn’t fully lift until my breathing was treated too	3
The pain keeps me awake, and the sleepless nights deepen the sadness	3
Lying in bed is like lying in a trap — my mind hurts, my body hurts, and rest never comes.	3
It’s not just the pain. It’s the emptiness that comes with it every night.	3
I wake up every hour, the ache in my back whispering that peace is not for me	3
Sometimes I dread sleep because I know it won't help — just more tossing, more pain.	3
The more tired I get, the more hopeless I feel — it’s like pain and depression are feeding on each other.	3
When I can’t sleep, I start to believe that I’ll never get better — mentally or physically.	3
Even after sleeping 9 hours, I feel bruised inside — like sleep didn’t reach where I needed it.	3
I cry at night, not because of the pain alone, but because the loneliness keeps me awake.	3
No pill touches this exhaustion, and no rest calms this sadness	3
They treat my pain like a physical issue, but the worst of it is emotional	3
My nights are long stretches of discomfort and dark thoughts.	3
Sleep is supposed to heal, but for me, it’s just another struggle.	3
It’s not that I don’t try to rest — it’s that my body won’t let me.	3
There’s no relief — just pain during the day and restlessness at night.	3
Sometimes the pain wakes me, but other times it’s just the weight of despair.	3
Lying still makes the pain louder and the thoughts darker	3
The nights feel endless. And yet, morning brings no energy or joy	3
I used to think I was just tired. Now I know I’m depressed too	3
I watch the clock tick, aching and awake, wondering how I’ll make it through another day.	3
I never thought pain could be this lonely.	3
The pain stops me from sleeping, and the depression stops me from hoping	3
They tell me to get more sleep, but sleep is the most elusive thing in my life.	3
I wake up drenched in fatigue, even if the pain took a night off	3
The worst part is not knowing which came first — the pain, the insomnia, or the sadness	3
I lie in bed scrolling for hours because I know I won’t fall asleep anyway	3
As soon as the lights go out, my brain switches on — I can’t stop thinking.	3
It takes forever to fall asleep, and by the time I do, it's almost morning.	3
I wake up in the middle of the night for no reason, just this heavy emptiness.	3
Every night I’m up two, three times. It's like my body forgot how to rest	3
Sometimes I wake up sweating, anxious, like I had a nightmare I can’t remember.	3
I always wake up around 5 a.m., wide-eyed and sad	3
Even if I fall asleep at 2 a.m., I still wake up before the sun.	3
The mornings are the worst — too early, too quiet, too much time to think.	3
I can sleep for 12 hours straight and still feel tired	3
I nap during class, after school, and before dinner — and I still feel empty	3
Everyone says teenagers sleep too much, but mine feels like an escape.	3
The less I sleep, the more everything hurts — my thoughts, my body, my life.	3
At night, all the sadness catches up with me — I feel trapped in my own head	3
Sleep used to be an escape. Now it's a reminder of how broken I feel	3
As a girl, they say I’m just moody. But my sleep is wrecked, and so is my mind.	3
I told my doctor I can’t sleep, but he said it’s just hormones. It’s not	3

I fall asleep in class, then stay up all night worrying — it’s a cycle.	3
My grades are slipping because I’m too tired to care	3
They think I’m lazy, but they don’t see the nights I spend staring at the ceiling.	3
My mind feels like it’s wrapped in fog — nothing gets through	3
I snap at everyone — I’m tired, I’m overwhelmed, and I hate myself for it.	3
I can’t focus on anything — my brain’s too tired to even feel sad properly	3
I’ve stopped hoping for a good night’s sleep — I just count down to morning.	3
I lie in bed for hours, begging for sleep that never comes.	3
Every time I close my eyes, my thoughts get louder	3
I fall asleep — then wake up — then lie awake until morning.	3
Sleep is no longer peaceful; it's a restless, hollow ritual.	3
Most nights, I don’t even know if I slept or just drifted	3
My eyes are heavy, but my mind is wide awake.	3
I wake up five times a night, and each time I feel more hopeless	3
Sleeping pills make me sleep, but I still feel dead inside	3
I used to love my bed. Now it just reminds me of all the nights I couldn’t rest	3
Every night I hope for relief, but the cycle repeats	3
I wake up before dawn, filled with dread and still exhausted	3
I track my sleep on apps, but they don’t show how broken I feel.	3
I feel punished every night — tossed between half-sleep and panic	3
The bed used to feel safe. Now it feels like a battleground.	3
I’ve forgotten what deep sleep feels like	3
I sleep 12 hours and still feel like a ghost	3
No amount of sleep fixes this crushing tiredness	3
They say I oversleep — I say I’m hiding	3
Sleep is my only escape from thinking, so I chase it constantly	3
Even after a nap, I feel like I haven’t slept in days	3
I sleep through alarms, appointments, entire mornings	3
I use sleep as a way to not feel.	3
Some days, I sleep to forget I exist	3
I live in bed, but I never feel rested	3
They call it laziness. I call it surviving	3
I fall asleep at 5 a.m. and wake up in the afternoon — my clock is broken	3
My body thinks it's night during the day and day during the night	3
The sun rises while I lie wide awake, praying to black out	3
I miss school because my sleep schedule has collapsed.	3
I feel like I'm living in a different time zone from everyone else.	3
I dream so fast, so vivid — it exhausts me	3
I wake up sweating, breathless, haunted by dreams that make no sense	3
My sleep feels shallow, like I never sink deep enough to heal.	3
I don’t dream like I used to — just static and flickers	3
My brain feels like it never turned off, even while asleep	3
Every night feels like a mental marathon I didn’t sign up for	3
I’m exhausted, but I can’t sleep — my mind races and my heart hurts	3
I pass out in class, but at night, I lie awake until 3 a.m	3
Menopause ruined my sleep, but depression made it unbearable	3
I sleep too much, feel too little, and drift through the day like smoke	3
Sleep used to be my comfort — now I wake every hour in silence	3
I crash at 6 a.m., miss all my lectures, and still feel unalive	3
I stay up worrying, sleep brokenly, then parent half-conscious	3
I sleep all day just to forget how worthless I feel.	3
The pain in my back won’t let me sleep, and neither will my mind	3
My body wakes me with aches, my mind with dread.	3
I snore myself awake and feel like I’ve been choking all night	3
I thought it was depression. Turns out I stop breathing in my sleep.	3
Anxiety jolts me awake before I even get the chance to sleep	3
Between my joints screaming and my brain racing, sleep doesn’t stand a chance	3

My therapist tells me to schedule pleasant activities. I can’t even imagine what that means now	2

I pretend to plan the future, but in truth, I can’t see myself in it.	6
Some days I stay alive out of habit, not hope	6
Every time I walk into the bathroom, I check for sharp things — and hide them	6
I rehearse exit strategies when I’m stuck in traffic or lying in bed	6
I’ve googled painless ways to die more than I’ve googled how to live	6
Sometimes I cry just thinking about how much easier it would be to not exist.	6
I’ve made peace with the idea that I might not grow old.	6
I’m tired of surviving — I want to feel alive or not at all	6
I don’t feel dramatic — I feel desperate	6
I fear if I speak honestly, they’ll lock me away instead of listening.	6
It’s not that I want to die — I just want everything to stop.	6
I wish people could see past the jokes and notice I’m drowning	6
Sometimes I wonder how many people are hiding pain like mine	6
It feels like I’m quietly disappearing from my own life.	6
At night, I imagine a world that continues just fine without me in it.	6
My heart beats, but it feels like I stopped existing months ago	6
I’m alive because I’m afraid to die — not because I want to live	6
When people say 'you’re strong,' I feel like they don’t know me at all.	6
I used to fear death — now it feels like a release	6
I feel like I’ve become a burden no one asked for.	6
I’ve written goodbye letters in my head — just in case	6
Even when I’m laughing, I wonder if this might be my last day.	6
I look at bridges and wonder what it would feel like to fall.	6
They say 'things get better,' but I stopped believing that a long time ago	6
It scares me that the idea of dying doesn’t scare me anymore	6
It feels like my brain is trying to convince me I’m better off gone.	6
The only reason I’m still here is because I don’t want to hurt my family	6
I hate how much effort it takes just to stay alive.	6
Each day is a negotiation between despair and inertia	6
Sometimes I hope an accident will make the decision for me	6
I started writing goodbye letters again — more seriously this time	6
If the opportunity presents itself, I won’t hesitate anymore.	6
My plan is complete. It’s just waiting for the right moment.	6
I set the alarm, not to wake up — but to remind myself when to act.	6
I keep the means nearby, just in case today is the day I finally go through with it.	6
I made sure my insurance was up to date. That’s how ready I am	6
I’ve stopped thinking about consequences — just about how soon it can end.	6
I skipped lunch today because I don’t think I’ll be here for dinner	6
I researched how to make it look like an accident so no one would blame themselves.	6
I smiled more this week — because I think I’ve made peace with leaving	6
There’s a comfort in knowing I could end it whenever I want	6
I held the pills in my hand last night and wondered if this was finally it	6
I picked out what I’d wear, what song I’d leave playing.	6
I cleaned my room not out of energy, but to leave things tidy when I’m gone.	6
It’s not a cry for help. It’s a quiet exit plan.	6
I’ve chosen the place, the method, and the day — only the execution is missing.	6
I found peace in the finality of the plan	6
Every night I calculate how much it would take to end this for good	6
I don’t want help — I want it over	6
I felt strangely calm once I committed to the idea of ending it	6
I don’t want anyone to find me — I want to disappear quietly	6
I’m only staying alive because I haven’t found the perfect moment yet.	6
It’s not impulsive anymore — it’s a decision I keep returning to	6
I drive past that tree every day and think, ‘maybe tomorrow I won’t swerve.’	6
I stood on the edge for too long — not by accident	6
I tested the weight on the rope, just to be sure	6
I stopped long enough to imagine how people would react to my death	6
When people say, ‘call if you need anything,’ I wish I could say, ‘I’m planning to die.’	6
My heart feels heavy all the time, like I'm carrying invisible weight	7
here’s no spark, no light — just emotional grey	7
I get overwhelmed by feelings I can’t name or control.	7
Even when good things happen, I feel nothing	7
It’s not just sadness — it’s the absence of anything else	7
I’m scared to feel again because all I remember is pain	7
My mood shifts from numb to hopeless — nothing in between	7
I can’t even remember the last time I felt truly excited about something	7
My emotions feel flat — like I’m stuck on mute inside.	7
I feel like my emotions are stuck in slow motion — everything lags	7
Sometimes I smile so people stop asking questions — not because I’m happy	7
There are days I can’t explain what I feel because it’s just too much	7
My mood crashes without warning and takes hours to come back up	7
I feel like I’m broken emotionally — like joy just skips over me	7
I haven’t felt joy in so long, I’m not sure I’d recognize it anymore	7
I experience moments of sadness so intense they take my breath away	7
I laugh in public and break down in private — it’s exhausting	7
The sadness is constant — it hums beneath everything I do	7
Some days I’m so irritable I can’t even stand the sound of my own voice	7
Happiness feels foreign, like a language I forgot how to speak	7
I don’t get angry anymore — just quietly overwhelmed.	7
I start crying for no reason, and I can't stop.	7
I cry at things that shouldn’t matter and feel nothing when they should	7
Even when I’m with people, I feel emotionally alone	7
Sometimes I feel so numb it scares me more than sadness ever did.	7
I feel like I’m acting all the time, pretending to be okay	7
My emotions used to color my world — now everything feels desaturated	7
I feel disconnected from my own emotions — like they belong to someone else.	7
I watch myself feeling sad from a distance — like it’s not fully mine	7
I feel like I’m watching life from behind a windowpane	7
I feel a bit off, like something’s missing but I can’t name it.	7
There’s a faint heaviness in me that lingers through the day.	7
I have moments of sadness, but they pass on their own	7
My emotions feel dulled — I don’t get excited like I used to.	7
I often feel like I’m going through the motions, not really living	7
I’ve stopped looking forward to things I once loved	7
There’s a constant pressure in my chest that won’t go away	7
I feel like crying but can’t find the tears	7
My emotions seem delayed — I react hours after something happens	7
The sadness crashes over me without warning and drowns everything else.	7
I feel emotionally paralyzed — I can’t feel joy, sorrow, or anything in between	7
Everything feels emotionally unbearable — even breathing feels like a task	7
My moods spiral quickly — from numb to panicked in minutes.	7
There are days when the pain inside feels too big to contain	7
There are days when I feel like my face has forgotten how to express anything but exhaustion and blankness	7
I miss the days when excitement was spontaneous and not a memory from another life	7
I used to light up when I saw the sun — now it just reminds me that I have to survive another day	7
Sometimes my sadness feels so alive, it’s like another person whispering in my ear that nothing will ever change	7
I feel stuck between extremes — numb one moment, overwhelmed by emotion the next, with no stability in between	7
My emotions are out of sync with reality — like I’m emotionally jet-lagged in my own life.	7
The hardest part is not feeling sad — it’s not feeling anything real for weeks at a time.	7
There’s a tight knot of unease in my stomach that never quite goes away — an emotional dread I carry with me.	7
My emotional world feels muted, like someone turned down the volume on life and left me behind in silence	7
I startle easily and cry over small inconveniences — my emotional skin feels raw and paper-thin	7
My chest feels heavy all the time — not from stress, but from an aching grief that I can’t explain	7
I feel emotionally fatigued — like my feelings are tired of trying to reach me.	7
When I feel happiness for a moment, I immediately brace for the crash that follows	7
When I try to explain how I feel, I run out of words because sadness doesn’t always have language	7
My affect is so flat that people think I’m cold, but inside I’m crumbling from emotional exhaustion	7
I no longer react with joy to things I used to love — it's as though my emotional wiring has been disconnected	7
Even when I sleep, I dream in grey — muted emotions, half-memories, and dull echoes of joy	7
My sadness doesn’t come in waves — it’s a continuous current that pulls at every part of me from the moment I wake up	7
I want to feel something — even if it's pain — because the numbness scares me more.	7
My emotional reactions feel misaligned — I get upset over trivial things and feel indifferent to things that should matter	7
I fake smiles so often that I sometimes forget what it feels like to genuinely laugh	7
I feel like I’m leaking sadness — it seeps into everything I do, touch, and think.	7
I’m not sure if I’m feeling too much or not feeling at all — both seem to happen at once.	7
I sometimes laugh, but it's empty — the kind that echoes without resonance	7
Even the word 'happy' feels foreign to me — I hear it, but I don’t remember what it feels like.	7
When someone shows me kindness, it makes me cry — not out of joy, but because I feel so undeserving of it.	7
It's as if joy tries to visit me, but there's a barrier it can't pass through anymore	7
Even when surrounded by laughter, I feel like I’m watching a movie I can't relate to — detached, confused, numb	7
Some days, I burst into tears without warning, and other days I want to cry but can't — the tears just won’t come	7

No matter how much time passes, I still wake up haunted, and I don’t see the point in trying anymore	6
It’s like the damage was done years ago, and now I’m just waiting for the end	6
I don’t want to die, but I can’t imagine a life where I ever feel safe again	6
The world feels permanently grey, and I can’t remember what hope ever felt like.	6
After what happened to me, I stopped believing things could ever get better.	6
Every time I try to heal, the memories pull me back, and I just want it to stop.	6
They say it gets better, but I’ve been waiting for that day for so long I’ve stopped believing it exists	6
There’s no future for someone like me—just more pain I can’t outrun	6
I don’t see a version of me that isn’t broken.	6
I learned how to survive trauma, but I never learned how to live.	6
Even on the good days, there’s a voice inside me asking why I’m still here	6
What they did to me stole everything, including my will to keep going	6
I don’t feel sad—I feel empty, like I was hollowed out and left behind	6
Every time I try to move forward, the past drags me down like an anchor.	6
If healing means carrying this forever, I’d rather not be here	6
I feel invisible, like my suffering never mattered—and maybe I don’t either.	6
Hope died the day I realized no one was coming to save me.	6
I’m so tired of fighting battles that started when I was a child	6
I’ve done everything I was told would help, and I still want it all to end	6
The pain is stuck inside me, and the only way out I can see is dying	6
Sometimes I wonder if the trauma rewired me so badly that I can’t function anymore	6
I can’t build a future when my past keeps tearing it down	6
I’ve lived with this pain for so long that death feels like the only relief.	6
They said I was strong for surviving, but no one sees how close I am to giving up	6
I’ve run out of explanations for why I feel this way—I just know I want it over	6
I’m tired of pretending that life is worth living when it just keeps hurting	6
Some nights I close my eyes hoping I won’t wake up	6
I’ve stopped asking for help because I’ve stopped expecting it to work	6
What happened to me taught me not to trust, and now I don’t even trust myself to stay alive	6
I don’t want to carry this anymore—my trauma, my pain, my life.	6
The people who were supposed to protect me were the ones who broke me the most	6
I grew up learning that love comes with pain, and now I don’t believe in either.	6
When your childhood is a war zone, suicide feels like a truce	6
I was punished for crying, so I stopped—and now the silence is killing me.	6
don’t want to live in a world that let them hurt me and called it discipline	6
My scars started at home, and now they’re the only part of me that feels honest.	6
Every time I think about dying, I wonder if they’d even notice I’m gone	6
I never felt safe as a child, and I’ve been trying to escape that feeling ever since	6
They told me I was a burden, and now I believe them	6
Being hit was easier than being ignored—at least pain meant I existed.	6
I didn’t grow up; I survived—and I’m too tired to keep surviving	6
They said they loved me, then broke me again—until I started thinking death might be love too	6
If home was where the hurt started, maybe disappearing is the only way to end it.	6
When love looks like fear, how do you learn to trust anyone again—including yourself?	6
They always said I was the problem, so I started believing the world would be better without me	6
Even now, their voices echo in my head telling me I’ll never be enough	6
I’m still trying to unlearn the belief that pain is what I deserve	6
I thought if I was perfect, they’d stop hurting me—but I’ve never stopped feeling broken.	6
They left bruises on my body and deeper ones on my mind	6
Sometimes I think dying is the only way to prove I wasn’t lying about how much it hurt	6
I never had a childhood—just years of hiding, flinching, and waiting for it to end.	6
I was taught that silence keeps you safe, and now it’s silencing me forever	6
The abuse didn’t end when I moved out—it lives inside me, every single day	6
I started thinking about suicide before I even knew the word for it	6
I wasn’t raised—I was damaged, and now I don’t know how to repair what they did	6
They taught me that love is pain, and now I use pain to feel loved	6
I kept wishing someone would see the pain, but no one ever opened the door.	6
I carry their anger in my bones and their shame in my skin.	6
I don’t know if I want to die—or if I just want to stop feeling like this child who was never wanted	6
Sometimes I think the only way to heal is to leave this life behind completely	6
Every cruel word they said at school still echoes louder than anything kind I've ever heard.	6
They laughed at my pain until I stopped showing it—and started cutting instead	6
I dreaded school not because of homework, but because I didn’t know if I could survive the hallway	6
They made me feel like a joke, and now I don’t even feel like a person	6
The bullying didn’t stop when I left the classroom—it followed me home through my phone	6
I started to believe them when they said I was better off dead	6
When everyone turns their back on you, self-harm becomes your only witness.	6
They didn’t just bully me—they erased me.	6
I go to university to disappear in the crowd, not to learn	6
The bruises faded, but the humiliation still eats me alive.	6
They mocked everything about me until I hated every part of myself.	6
I smile in class, but in the bathroom stall I fall apart	6
Each shove, each slur, each whisper behind my back built the case for why I shouldn't be alive	6
They called me weak, but they had no idea how strong I had to be just to keep showing up	6
I scroll through old messages and wonder how I didn’t break sooner	6
They laughed when I cried, so I stopped crying—and started cutting	6
At school I was invisible unless they wanted someone to hurt.	6
They spread lies and I couldn’t defend myself—I barely knew who I was anymore.	6
I kept telling adults what was happening, but no one ever really listened.	6
By the time I got to university, I had already internalized the idea that I didn’t belong anywhere.	6
Being different made me a target—and eventually made me want to disappear	6
No one saw the pain behind the jokes they made at my expense	6
The cafeteria was a battlefield, and I was always outnumbered.	6
The bullying didn't kill me—but it planted the idea that death might be easier	6
They called me names every day until I started whispering them to myself.	6
The group chats, the glances, the laughter—it all made me want to fade out of existence.	6
I wanted someone to notice I was falling apart, but all they noticed was my silence	6
I hurt myself because it was the only pain I could control.	6
They said it was just teasing—but I still have scars to prove it wasn’t.	6
I go through every day pretending I’m fine while carrying the weight of every cruel thing they ever said	6
They said I was disgusting for loving who I loved, and after a while, I started to agree	6
I learned to flinch at my own reflection because they made my identity feel like a punchline	6
The closet didn’t protect me—it just trapped me with my pain.	6
They turned my gender into a slur, and now I struggle to say it out loud.	6
Each time someone said ‘that’s so gay’ as an insult, I sank deeper into silence.	6
Coming out cost me friends, safety, and the will to keep going	6
I cut myself not because I’m weak, but because being myself felt like a fight I couldn’t win	6
I kept waiting for school to feel like a safe place—but being queer made me a target before I even spoke.	6
They laughed at my clothes, my voice, my name—and now I avoid mirrors entirely.	6
Every time I heard the word ‘freak,’ I thought maybe I shouldn’t exist.	6
Being out at university didn’t mean being safe—it just meant being visible to people who hated me.	6
They told me to kill myself in the hallway, and no teacher said a word.	6
When even your family says you’re wrong for who you are, death starts sounding like mercy	6
I hurt myself to remind myself that I’m real, even if no one wants to see me	6
I pretended to be straight until the act broke me	6
They used my pronouns as a joke until I stopped correcting them and started hating myself.	6
I asked for help and got told I was ‘just confused’—as if that made the pain disappear	6
Being queer wasn’t the problem—it was being queer in a world that wanted me to hate it	6
I tried so hard to fit in that I almost erased myself entirely	6
When your identity becomes ammunition for bullying, you stop believing you deserve to exist	6
\I wasn’t depressed because I was queer—I was depressed because of how people treated me for it.	6
They stripped me of my dignity and called it ‘just teasing’—but I still carry the scars	6
Every snicker in the locker room was a reminder that I was unsafe, even in my own body	6
At school, I learned to shrink; at home, I learned to disappear.	6
I used to pray I’d wake up straight—now I just pray I wake up at all	6
They turned my identity into a curse, and I started to believe the only cure was death.	6
When I reached out to a counselor, they told me to tone it down—like my life was too loud to matter.	6
I stay silent in classrooms so no one can find another reason to hate me	6
Being queer felt like a death sentence long before I ever wanted to die.	6
I dream of a life where being myself isn’t a source of pain—but some days, I just dream of not waking up	6
I’ve already written the note—I’m just deciding when to follow through	6
If I go back to that house, I will not survive the night.	6
The things they did to me still make me want to end my life, even years later.	6
Every time I remember what happened, I self-harm just to feel in control again.	6
I've already tried to die once, and I’m thinking more seriously about trying again	6
If disappearing permanently is the only way to make the pain stop, then so be it.	6
I dream about dying more than I dream about living	6
The urge to hurt myself is constant, and I don’t know how much longer I can resist it.	6
They broke me when I was too young to understand, and now all I understand is wanting to die	6
When I look at the pills, I don’t see medication—I see an exit.	6
The more I try to survive, the more I want to stop trying	6
The trauma is louder than my heartbeat, and I’m tired of listening to it.	6
I’ve planned my suicide in detail—I’m just waiting for the moment I no longer care	6
The blade is the only thing that makes me feel less dead inside	6
I’ve rehearsed what I’ll say in my goodbye video.	6
I’ve given away things I care about—I don’t expect to be here much longer	6
The pain is permanent, so maybe my solution should be too.	6
I harmed myself worse this time—it’s escalating, and I’m scared of what comes next.	6
Every day I don’t act on my suicidal thoughts feels like borrowed time.	6
I don’t think I’ll make it through the next breakdown alive	6
I wake up every morning disappointed that I’m still here	6
They pushed me so far I’ve started planning how to end it.	6
Every day I step into school, I feel closer to killing myself.	6
If one more person mocks me, I swear I won’t survive it.	6
The humiliation has built up for years—death feels like my only escape	6
I’ve started cutting deeper, and I don’t even care if I go too far	6
I've looked up how to do it quietly, efficiently, without anyone stopping me.	6
The bullying hasn’t just hurt me—it’s made me believe I deserve to die.	6
I cried out for help so many times that I gave up and made a plan instead	6
The schoolyard became my graveyard the day I stopped fighting the urge to die.	6
My suicide is not a question of ‘if,’ just ‘when.’	6
No one took it seriously when I said I wanted to die—but I wasn’t joking.	6
I've drawn maps of where I want my body to be found	6
Every new message I get makes my desire to die stronger.	6
I feel like a corpse with homework	6
The pressure of pretending to be okay is making me plan my way out.	6
I used to cry—now I just count down to the end	6
The bullying won’t stop, so maybe I will	6
They gave me a nickname I still hear in my head every time I hold a blade	6
I no longer go to class to learn—I go to say goodbye.	6
The bullies broke more than my spirit—they made me write my goodbye.	6
I’m done trying to survive in a world that wants me erased	6
Every time they mock who I am, I think about ending it all.	6
If being myself means living in this kind of pain, I’d rather not live at all	6
I've already attempted suicide once because of what they called me—I don’t know if I’ll survive another round.	6
I wrote ‘I’m sorry’ in lipstick on the mirror the night I almost did it	6
They said I didn’t deserve to live—and sometimes I believe them	6
I tried to ‘pray the gay away,’ and when that didn’t work, I started planning my death instead	6
I’ve started stockpiling pills—just in case it gets worse.	6
I don’t know if I’ll make it through this semester without doing something permanent	6
I’ve researched painless ways to die because I don’t want to keep feeling this way	6
They say ‘It gets better,’ but I’m already too deep in planning my way out.	6
I see my deadname and want to be dead instead.	6
I stopped correcting people because I don’t plan on being here long enough for it to matter.	6
I've thought of ending my life on the anniversary of coming out—it feels symbolic	6
The only thing more painful than hiding my identity is being punished for revealing it.	6
They think I’m dramatic, but I’m documenting this in case I don’t survive.	6
I leave notes on my phone in case someone finds them after I’m gone	6
Living out loud has put a target on my back, and I’m too tired to keep dodging bullets.	6
I’ve had to choose between being seen and staying alive.	6
There’s no safe space left, so I’ve started planning an end to the pain.	6
I’ve picked the date and location—it’s the only thing I feel certain about.	6
I’m no longer afraid of dying—I’m afraid of surviving another week like this	6
I've stopped making plans because I don’t plan to be around	6
They’ll say ‘I didn’t know,’ but I’ve been screaming in silence for months	6
This will be my last journal entry—there’s nothing left to say	6
I’ve given up on recovery—I just want peace, even if it means death.	6
I feel like I’m already gone—just waiting for my body to catch up.	6
I smile in public because I don’t want them to stop me.	6
The rope is in my closet, and the thoughts are louder every night.	6
No one noticed when I started saying goodbye with my eyes	6
I googled ‘how many pills is too many’ last night.	6
I told them I was fine because I didn’t want to be stopped.	6
The pain is constant, and so is the desire to end it.	6
The knife is no longer scary—it feels like a friend.	6
There’s a part of me that’s already halfway out the door	6
I keep my methods secret now—I’ve learned not to give people a chance to intervene	6
I’m living out of obligation, not desire.	6
I feel like I’ve already said my goodbyes—just not out loud	6
Each new morning feels like a punishment I didn’t ask for.	6
The end is not just an idea anymore—it’s becoming a decision.	6
The second they walked out, I picked up the blade without thinking	6
When he said it was over, I grabbed the pills before I could feel the pain.	6
She blocked me, and I smashed the mirror—then I used the shards on myself	6
I didn’t plan to hurt myself—I just needed the pain to match what I felt when she left.	6
The breakup hit me like a train, and I ended up in the ER before I even processed it.	6
One fight and I was on the balcony railing—I didn’t care if it was stupid	6
He ghosted me for a week and I ended up cutting deeper than I ever had.	6
When she told me she cheated, I put my fist through the wall—and then into myself	6
It wasn’t a suicide attempt, it was a scream with my blood.	6
I didn’t want to die, I just didn’t want to be alive without him	6
I didn’t think—I just drank everything in the cabinet the minute she slammed the door	6
I punched a wall, then swallowed a handful of anything I could find	6
He said we were done, and I wanted to make sure he’d never forget what he did to me.	6
I couldn’t control the rage, so I turned it inward.	6
My hand moved faster than my thoughts—one second I was crying, the next I was bleeding.	6
I begged him not to leave, and when he did, I picked up the knife without hesitation	6
We argued, I saw red, and then I tried to disappear forever.	6
I felt discarded like trash, so I treated myself like it	6
My love for her turned into hate—for myself.	6
When he said he didn’t love me anymore, I decided I wouldn’t either	6
One text ended everything—my relationship, my hope, my will to live.	6
They told me not to make it about life or death, but that’s all I felt it was.	6
I was too ashamed to tell anyone I’d just tried to kill myself over a fight	6
She hung up on me, and I thought: fine, let’s make it final.	6
I thought hurting myself would stop the emotional pain—just for a moment.	6
The breakup made me feel like a ghost, so I tried to become one	6
It wasn’t even a huge fight—I just lost it and ended up at the hospital again	6
He cheated and I carved the betrayal into my skin.	6
We fought, I snapped, and now I have the scars to remember it by.	6
Every time someone leaves, I try to leave too—permanently	6
He said if I ever left, he’d hurt himself—so I stayed until I started hurting myself instead.	6
She called me worthless so many times I began cutting just to feel something other than shame	6
I swallowed the pills the night he told me I wasn’t enough and never would be	6
Every time I tried to leave, he threatened suicide—until I started thinking maybe I should be the one to die	6
He cheated and made it my fault, and I punished myself for not being lovable	6
She told me no one else would want me—and now I don’t even want myself.	6
I started hurting myself in secret after he laughed when I cried	6
When your whole self-worth is tied to someone toxic, losing them feels like losing your life.	6
He said, ‘Go ahead, kill yourself,’ so I tried.	6
I felt more trapped in the relationship than I did in my own depression	6
Every time she threatened to leave, I imagined jumping in front of a train	6
He convinced me I was crazy, so I cut just to check if I could still feel.	6
I lost myself trying to keep him, and now I don’t care if I lose my life too	6
Her love came with conditions, and the more I failed, the more I bled.	6
He broke my phone, isolated me, and said I was lucky he loved me—so I carved ‘love’ into my arm	6
She’d disappear for days, and I’d stay up all night thinking of ways to die.	6
He watched me cry and called it manipulation, so I tried to disappear permanently.	6
Being with her felt like dying in slow motion—so I sped it up myself.	6
He made me block all my friends, and now the only voice I hear is the one telling me I shouldn’t exist.	6
When she said, ‘I never really loved you,’ I made sure my last text would be a goodbye	6
I cut myself after every fight—because that was the only apology I ever got.	6
He said I was lucky anyone tolerated me, and I started to believe the world would be better off without me.	6
he used my mental illness against me so often I stopped seeking help and started seeking pain	6
I wasn’t allowed to cry, question, or leave—so I started hurting myself quietly.	6
He told me he’d kill himself if I left—so I stayed and tried to die slowly instead.	6
She loved me only when I obeyed, and I began self-harming just to feel a moment of control.	6
When he screamed ‘You ruin everything,’ I ran to the bathroom and didn’t come out until I was bleeding	6
I lived in fear of making her angry—and started using pain as a way to keep myself quiet.	6
I told him I wanted space and he sent me a picture of his slit wrists—and now I’m the one with scars.	6
By the time I realized it wasn’t love, I’d already lost the will to live	6
When I got laid off, I didn’t just lose a job—I lost the last reason I had to get out of bed	6
I stared at my eviction notice and thought, ‘There’s nowhere left to go—maybe not even in life.	6
The debt collectors call every day, and sometimes I wish it was a call telling me I didn’t have to wake up again.	6
When I couldn’t buy groceries for my kids, I started thinking they’d be better off without me.	6
I lost my job and found a razor—one seemed like a relief from the other	6
It’s not just poverty—it’s the way it makes you invisible and worthless.	6
I feel like a failure every time I can’t afford rent, and the shame cuts deeper than the blade	6
The day I couldn’t pay my electricity bill, I planned how to end everything	6
Each rejection email chips away at my will to live	6
I used to be someone people respected—now I’m just someone trying not to die before payday	6
They say money doesn’t buy happiness, but I had both before I lost everything	6
I scroll past job ads with tears in my eyes, knowing I’m not even stable enough to try.	6
I overdrafted again, and this time, I started writing a goodbye note instead of a budget	6
I feel like I’m drowning in bills, and death seems like the only way out.	6
Losing my job shattered my identity—I don’t know who I am without work or purpose	6
Unemployment has turned every day into a silent scream	6
The food bank was my last stop before seriously planning suicide	6
I can't look my family in the eyes without imagining what life would be like for them without me	6
I wake up and check my bank account, and it makes me want to never wake up again.	6
Every cent I spend feels like another reason I shouldn’t be alive	6
My worth used to be measured by my job—now I feel like I’m worth nothing	6
“I’m tired of pretending I’m okay when I can’t afford to live	6
They repossessed my car, and I started thinking about letting them take my life too	6
It’s not just about money—it’s the constant fear, the shame, the isolation that pushes me to the edge	6
I used to daydream about vacations—now I fantasize about vanishing	6
Losing my business felt like losing a limb—now I just want to stop feeling anything at all.	6
I can’t support my family, and I can’t support my own thoughts anymore either.	6
Every financial crisis feels like a countdown to something worse—something final	6
When you’ve sold everything valuable and still can’t survive, it starts to feel like your life is the next thing to give up.	6
I keep my overdraft letters in a drawer next to my sleeping pills	6
I survived the earthquake, but the emptiness it left behind is killing me slowly.	6
They pulled me from the rubble—now I just wish they hadn’t.	6
The fire burned down more than my house—it burned the last reason I had to keep going.	6
Losing my family in the storm made life feel like a punishment I didn’t deserve to serve.	6
I keep reliving the moment the tsunami hit, and every time I cut, it feels like drowning all over again	6
The world collapsed around me—and now it’s collapsing inside me too	6
I wake up in this shelter with strangers, but the only thought I have is: how can I disappear?	6
They say I was lucky to survive, but I feel cursed to be alive.	6
I haven’t seen my child since the war started, and I don’t want to live in a world where I never do.	6
Each siren sends me back into panic, and each panic ends with a blade in my hand.	6
After the pandemic took my parents, I stopped wearing a mask—I hoped it would take me too	6
The hunger, the chaos, the fear—it all makes dying feel like a form of peace	6
The aftershocks stopped, but the shaking inside me hasn’t.	6
I don’t know what’s worse—the silence after the bomb, or the silence I now live with inside	6
I lost everything in that storm—including my will to survive.	6
Every time it rains, I remember the flood, and I want to wash myself out of this life.	6
I’ve stopped asking for aid—I just want a way out	6
The rescue team saved my body, but they couldn’t reach my soul.	6
I smile when they talk about rebuilding, but all I want is to break completely	6
I used to dream about the future—now I dream about not waking up	6
The fire spared me, but I keep wondering if that was a mistake.	6
When the quake hit, I ran for safety—now I run from the thoughts in my head	6
I haven’t felt clean since the flood, and now I bleed just to feel anything at all	6
War stole my childhood, my home, and now it’s trying to take my life through my own hands	6
I lost my husband in the storm, and I keep thinking I should’ve gone with him	6
Each news alert sends me spiraling—I can’t tell what’s worse: the world or my mind.	6
The disease took my grandparents, and I started self-harming just to hold on to something real	6
